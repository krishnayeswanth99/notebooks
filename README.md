## [GPU_set_classifcation](GPU_set_classification.ipynb) <br/>
It contains basic pytorch model running with gpu.<br/>
The data for the model can be derived from [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz)<br/>
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.<br/>
## [Language of Name](Lang_from_word.ipynb) <br/>
It contains a word classifier to determine the language of word.<br/>
The data used for above model is derived from [pytorch tutorial data](https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/data.zip)<br/>
It contais text from 18 different languages in the folder names.
## [Machine_Translation](Machine_Translation.ipynb) <br/>
The data used is same as that of pytorch tutorial from above.<br/>
We are translating from french to english.
